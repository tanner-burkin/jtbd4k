# John Burkin Ethical Considerations

1. I'm concerned about the ethics behind non disclosure agreements and how people go about not disclosing things about software that they shouldn't.
2. I'm also concerned about the ethics behind sharing user data.
3. Lastly, I am concerned about the ethics behind privacy in software.
